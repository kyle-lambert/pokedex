## Requirements

Your task is to build a functioning Pokédex using the public [PokéAPI](https://pokeapi.co/).

### Design
All required assets are provided in the `/Assets` folder.
The design is located in the `/Design` folder which is a Sketch file. This can also be viewed in [InVision](https://invis.io/ED10OOB8C587#/449192372_Pokedex). If you would like to use the InVision developer inspect functionality, you will need to create an account and request access.

- Selecting a Pokémon should display more details to the right of the screen
- Search should filter the list of Pokémon by name
- If you find the design is missing any details, you can fill the gaps with whatever you think works best

### Technology
- The frontend should be built using [React](https://reactjs.org/). Bootstrapping with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) is optional
- Free choice to use any other technologies

### Finished product
- Complete as much as possible. It does not need to be 100% completed, but should be handed over in a working state
- The project should be built within a public Git repository
- Deploy the application to a hosting provider (e.g. Netlify, Vercel, Heroku)
- Once completed, please provide the link to your Git repository and deployed application


### Bonus points (optional)
- Server side rendering or Static site generation
- Lazy loading images
- Image optimisation (if necessary)
